# Skill 17 - Competition Environment

Competition environment for competitors.

- Are you planning to take part in a competition in Web Technologies â€” Skill 17?
- Did the organizers of the competition provide you with a link to this repository?

Then you are in the right place!

What can be found here?

- Instructions on how set up your environment for the competition.
- Example problems to test your setup.
- Instructions on how to submit your solution.

Please go through these instructions and verify your setup before the competition starts.

__It is important that you go through the instructions several days before. In case there is an issue, you have time to
resolve it or contact the organizers.__

## Instructions

### 1. Installation

1. Install Docker if you haven't already. We recommend [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Install Git if you haven't already. We recommend [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:skills17/competition-manager.git`

Hints:

- Make sure that Docker is running with at least 4 GB of memory.
- Make sure that you have enough disk space available. To be on the safe side, check that you have at least 20 GB
  available.
- Make sure that Docker has access to the folder you cloned this repository to. You might need to add the folder to the
  list in Docker Desktop under Resources > File sharing.
- Optional: If you worked with Docker before, you might want to prune your system first:

```bash
# Remove all unused containers, networks, images, and volumes.
docker system prune --all --volumes
```

### 2. Starting the environment

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory of this repository.
2. Run `docker compose up -d` to start the environment.
3. Wait a few seconds and verify that the environment is healthy by running `docker ps`.

You now have a running environment with all the tools you need to fetch, solve and submit the tasks.

The following ports are exposed:

- `9999`: The web server for fetching the tasks and instructions as well as submitting your solution.

Hints:

- If you get an error that the port is already in use, you might have another service running on port 9999. You need to
  stop that service or change the port in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### 3. Fetching the competition tasks

On the started server [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999), you can fetch the tasks for the competition. Please do so before the
competition starts. A hash is also provided to verify the integrity of the tasks. If the competition tasks are not yet
available, please check again a few days before the competition starts.

The downloaded tasks are encrypted and can only be decrypted with a password provided by the organizers. You will be
given the password at the start of the competition. This allows you to download the tasks in advance and start solving
them as soon as the competition starts.

### 4. Decrypting the tasks

Once you have the password, you can decrypt the tasks on the website [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999).

Instructions on how to solve the tasks can be found on the displayed link after successfully decrypting the tasks.
The setup can differ from competition to competition. You probably will need to start another set of Docker containers.

The decrypted tasks will be available locally in the `competitions/workspace/:competition/` directory.

### 5. Uploading your solution

You can upload and submit your solution as many times as you want. Only the last submission will be considered.
Submissions after the deadline, that was communicated to you by the organizers, will be ignored.

To submit your solution, open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9999](http://localhost:9999). Select the competition you want to
upload your solution to and click on `Submit`.

To verify that your solution has been submitted, you can check the separate URL that is displayed after submitting your
solution.

### 6. Stop the environment

The containers are running in the background. You can stop them with `docker compose down` while being in the directory.
