# Competition Manager Roadmap

## Events where the Competition Manager was used

- Swiss Regional Skills, Web Technology, 2024. 63 participants.

## Backlog

### High Priority

- Registration of competitor details within competition manager instead of competition
- Allow downloading of competition with only secret parts encrypted. Things like `setup.js` and `package.json` can be
  unencrypted. This would allow to set up the competition before the competition starts.
- Add support for speed challenge tasks.

### Low Priority

- Synchronize work files with server for live evaluation

## Before SwissSkills 2025

TBD
